                        An optimized approach to solving this problem is to find a candidate element A[i] find a chance
                         where it could probably be the majority element, Afterwards, a traversal can be done on the array A,
                          keeping count of the number of occurrences of that particular candidate element that was pre-determined.
                           If the count is greater than n/2 then the candidate element can be returned as the majority, else, return 
                           the value of choice to indicate that there is no majority element in that particular group.
